## Helium Web Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Helium, a lightweight, configurable micro web framework for Zig.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This roadmap is a living document and may change based on community feedback and evolving needs.

### Philosophy & Design Goals

Helium is designed as a **micro-framework** with these core principles:
- **Configurability First**: Nothing is hardcoded; everything is opt-in and customizable
- **Minimal Core**: Keep the core API small and focused
- **Composability**: Features should be independent and composable
- **Zero Magic**: Explicit, predictable behavior without hidden abstractions
- **Performance**: Efficient use of resources with multiple concurrency models

### âœ… Implemented Features

#### Core Framework
- [x] Generic `App` type with custom context support
- [x] Type-safe request handlers and middleware
- [x] Configurable memory allocator per application
- [x] Custom error handler support
- [x] Multi-mode server (thread pool and event-driven I/O)

#### Routing System
- [x] Express.js-like routing API
- [x] HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)
- [x] Dynamic route parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`)
- [x] Query parameter parsing
- [x] Route grouping with shared path prefixes
- [x] Tree-based router for efficient path matching

#### Middleware System
- [x] Global middleware (applied to all routes)
- [x] Group-scoped middleware (applied to route groups)
- [x] Route-specific middleware chains
- [x] Middleware composition with `next()` pattern
- [x] Type-safe middleware signatures

#### Built-in Utilities
- [x] CORS middleware (allow-all origins)
- [x] Static file server with path traversal protection
- [x] Common log format middleware with timing
- [x] JSON response helpers

#### Request/Response
- [x] Request parameter access (path params, query params)
- [x] Request body string access
- [x] Response status code setting
- [x] Response header management
- [x] JSON response serialization
- [x] Plain text responses
