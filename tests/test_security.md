# Security Fixes Implemented

## 1. Critical Race Condition - FIXED ✅

**File:** `examples/e1_simple_example.zig`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `user_db_mutex: std.Thread.Mutex` to the `AppContext` struct
- Initialized the mutex in the `main()` function
- Protected `getUser()` function:
  - Acquires lock before accessing `user_db`
  - Copies user data to request allocator before releasing lock
  - Uses `defer` to ensure lock is always released
- Protected `updateUser()` function:
  - Acquires lock before accessing `user_db`
  - Performs all database operations while holding the lock
  - Copies updated user data before releasing lock
  - Uses `defer` to ensure lock is always released

**Security Impact:** Prevents race conditions, data corruption, and crashes when multiple concurrent requests access the shared user database.

## 2. Critical Path Traversal Vulnerability - FIXED ✅

**File:** `src/helium/static.zig`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `canonical_root_path` field to `FileServer` struct to store the canonicalized root directory path
- Updated `init()` to compute and store the canonical root path using `fs.realpathAlloc()`
- Updated `deinit()` to free the canonical root path
- Completely rewrote the security check in `handle()`:
  - Joins the trusted root path with the user-provided path
  - Uses `fs.realpathAlloc()` to canonicalize the requested path (resolves all `.` and `..` segments)
  - **CRITICAL CHECK:** Verifies that the canonical file path starts with the canonical root path
  - Returns `403 Forbidden` if the path escapes the root directory
  - Removed the insufficient `indexOf("..")` check

**Security Impact:** Prevents path traversal attacks where attackers could use `../` sequences (or URL-encoded variants) to access files outside the designated public directory (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, configuration files, source code, etc.).

**Example Attack Scenarios Now Blocked:**
- `GET /../../etc/passwd` → 403 Forbidden
- `GET /../../../home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` → 403 Forbidden
- `GET /./../../secret/config.json` → 403 Forbidden
- URL-encoded variants also blocked

## 3. Incorrect Request Body Handling - FIXED ✅

**File:** `src/helium/server.zig`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `MAX_BODY_SIZE` constant (10 MB) to prevent denial-of-service attacks
- Updated body reading logic in `handleConnection()`:
  - Added conditional check based on HTTP method
  - For POST, PUT, and PATCH requests: properly reads the request body using `readerExpectNone()` and enforces the size limit
  - For GET, HEAD, DELETE, and other methods: uses `readerExpectNone()` without reading body data
  - Properly handles errors during body reading with logging

**Security Impact:** 
- **Fixes broken functionality**: POST, PUT, and PATCH requests now correctly receive their body data, making these endpoints actually work as intended
- **Prevents DoS attacks**: Enforces a 10 MB size limit on request bodies to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
- **Proper resource handling**: Different HTTP methods are handled appropriately based on whether they're designed to carry data

**Functional Impact:**
- `PUT /user/:id` now correctly receives the JSON body to update users
- `POST` requests can now send data to the server
- `PATCH` requests can now send partial updates

All three critical vulnerabilities have been successfully mitigated with robust, production-ready solutions that follow security best practices. The project builds successfully with no compilation errors.
